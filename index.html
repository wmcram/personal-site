    <main>
        <p>I'm a student majoring in Math and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I learned how to program long before LLMs came around if that means anything to you.
        This past summer, I worked on observability in Kubernetes clusters at AWS. At the moment I've been diving deeper into the Rust programming language.
        <br/>
        You can contact me at <strong>wcram 'at' wisc 'dot' edu</strong>; I'll try to get back to you within a day or two.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of some things I'm interested in:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Math
                <ul>
                    <li>Logic and its families (Substructural, Modal, Intuitionistic)</li>
                    <li>Category Theory (<em>cliche, I know</em>)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Computer Science
                <ul>
                    <li>Distributed Systems</li>
                    <li>Compilers</li>
                    <li>PLT</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Other
                <ul>
                    <li>Physics</li>
                    <li>Japanese and Russian languages</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        

        <p>Some food for thought:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">BB(6)</a> and higher are physically unrealizable in conjunction with the fact that
                many deep mathematical statements require >5 states to encode their "haltiness" into a Turing Machine indicates that abstraction and changes in perspective are
                a fundamentally necessary part of truth-seeking.
            </li>
            <li>
                By and large, college courses (not all the other parts of college) are a waste of time. A majority of
                the material can be learned for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">free</a> on one's own time in a more efficient and comprehensive way.
                I really believe in what <a href="https://www.mathacademy.com/">MathAcademy</a> and <a href="https://lemnisket.com/">Lemnisket</a> are
                doing to make this a reality.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since market prices are a (slightly lossy) mechanism for signalling supply, demand, and risk, a lossless signal
                would correspond to a perfect market where all present and future states of the world are known to all participants. If we take the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory">thermodynamic view</a> of entropy, this would correspond to the heat death of an economy, since no rational actor would
                have an incentive to trade. As our statistical models of the world become increasingly accurate, we can expect to see 
                the price of anything converge to its "true" value in some platonic sense. All this to say, maybe the alchemists were right?
