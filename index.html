        <p>I'm a student majoring in Math and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
        This summer, I'll be interning at AWS. 
        You can contact me at <strong>wcram 'at' wisc 'dot' edu</strong>, I'll try to get back to you within a day or two.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of some things I'm interested in:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Math
                <ul>
                    <li>Logic and its families (Substructural, Modal, Intuitionistic)</li>
                    <li>Category Theory (<em>cliche, I know</em>)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Computer Science
                <ul>
                    <li>Distributed Systems</li>
                    <li>Compilers</li>
                    <li>PLT</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Other
                <ul>
                    <li>Physics</li>
                    <li>Japanese and Russian languages</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        

        <p>Some food for thought:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">BB(6)</a> and higher are physically unrealizable in conjunction with the fact that
                many deep mathematical statements require >5 states to encode their "haltiness" into a Turing Machine indicates that abstraction and changes in perspective are
                a fundamentally necessary part of truth-seeking.
            </li>
            <li>
                By and large, college courses (not the rest of college) are a waste of time. A majority of
                the material can be learned for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">free</a> on one's own time in a more efficient and comprehensive way.
                Furthermore, now that LLMs serve as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem">personal tutor</a>, 
                the traditional barriers to self-teaching are lower than ever. In an ideal world, students would learn in dialogue with an LLM,
                and solve many problems socratically. If the pacing is tuned appropriately, there would be almost no need
                for exams or even discrete boundaries between courses.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since market prices are a (slightly lossy) mechanism for signalling supply, demand, and risk, a lossless signal
                would correspond to a perfect market where all present and future states of the world are known to all participants. If we take the 
                thermodynamic view of entropy, this would correspond to the heat death of an economy, since no rational actor would
                have an incentive to trade. As our statistical models of the world become increasingly accurate, we can expect to see 
                the price of anything converge to its "true" value in some platonic sense. All this to say, maybe the alchemists were right?
