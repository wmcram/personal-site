  <main>
    <p>I'm a student majoring in Math and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I learned how to
      program long before LLMs came around if that means anything to you.
      This past summer, I worked on observability in Kubernetes clusters at AWS. At the moment I've been diving deeper
      into Type Theory.
      <br />
      You can contact me at <strong>wcram 'at' wisc 'dot' edu</strong>; I'll try to get back to you within a day or two.
    </p>
    <p>Here's a list of some things I'm interested in:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Math
        <ul>
          <li>Logic and its families (Substructural, Modal, Intuitionistic)</li>
          <li>Category Theory (<em>cliche, I know</em>)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Computer Science
        <ul>
          <li>Functional Programming</li>
          <li>PLT (More specifically, expressing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system">more</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system#Linear_type_systems">things</a> with types)</li>
          <li>Distributed Systems</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Other
        <ul>
          <li>Quantum Computers</li>
          <li>Japanese and Russian languages</li>
          <li>Running, Skiing, Hiking</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <p>Some food for thought:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">BB(6)</a> and higher are physically
        unrealizable in conjunction with the fact that
        many deep mathematical statements require >5 states to encode their "haltiness" into a Turing Machine indicates
        that abstraction and changes in perspective are
        a fundamentally necessary part of truth-seeking.
      </li>
      <li>
        By and large, college courses (not all the other parts of college) are a waste of time. A majority of
        the material can be learned (for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">free</a>) on one's own time in a more efficient
        and comprehensive way.
        I really believe in what <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> and more recently <a href="https://www.mathacademy.com/">MathAcademy</a> is
        doing to make this a reality.
