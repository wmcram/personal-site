    <main>
        <p>I'm a student majoring in Math and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
        This summer, I'll be interning at Amazon. Currently torn between research and industry. 
        You can contact me at <strong>wcram 'at' wisc 'dot' edu</strong>, I'll try to get back to you within a day or two.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of some things I'm interested in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Math
                <ul>
                    <li>Logic (Substructural, <strong>Modal</strong>, Intuitionistic)</li>
                    <li>Algebra and <strong>Topology</strong>
                    <li>Category Theory (<em>cliche, I know</em>)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Computer Science
                <ul>
                    <li>PL Theory</li>
                    <li>Functional language features</li>
                    <li>Computability Theory</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Other
                <ul>
                    <li>Physics, and more specifically how its laws restrict physically-realizable computation</li>
                    <li>Automated theorem-proving</li>
                    <li>Japanese and Russian languages</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here's some "takes" on various topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>While I believe AI will transform the landscape of the software industry and many adjacent sectors, 
                I don't think we will acheive ASI in my lifetime. This isn't even because I think it's technically impossible,
                rather that superintelligence can't (and shouldn't) spontaneously arise through largely "verbal" communication. 
            </li>
            <li>The fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">BB(6)</a> and higher are "physically unrealizable" in conjunction with the fact that
                many nontrivial mathematical statements require >5 states to "encode" into a Turing Machine indicates that abstraction and changes in perspective are
                a fundamentally necessary part of truth-seeking.
            </li>
            <li>
                By and large, college courses (not the rest of college) are a waste of time. A majority of
                the material can be learned for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">free</a> on one's own time in a more efficient and comprehensive way.
                Furthermore, now that LLMs serve as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem">personal tutor</a>, 
                the traditional barriers to self-teaching are lower than ever. In an ideal world, students would learn in dialogue with an LLM,
                solve many problems socratically, and then take a test to demonstrate their knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
                Having a morning alarm is the single worst you can do for your overall health.
            </li>
            <li>
                Many so-called "rationalists" would do well to go with their gut more often.
            </li>
        </ul>
